v1.2.0 -- **May 14th 2015**

**Breaking changes**

There are a few changes that affect backwards compatibility:

* The `default` Postgres backend, which utilizes `ngx_postgres`, has been entirely removed. Early users of Lapis are recommended to upgrade to `pgmoon`
* The `has_many` relation now defines two methods: the `get_relation` method no longer returns a pager but all the associated rows. A new method, `get_relation_paginated` will return a pager

#### Database

* Add support for MySQL (Thanks [starius](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/pull/250))
* Add `db.list` for automatically building SQL list syntax for `where x in ()` queries

#### Models

* `include_in` can now preload many associated objects when `many` option is set to true
* A flipped `include_in` can now specify the `local_key` to use a different key than `id`
* Add `polymorphic_belongs_to` relation
* `has_many` now defines two methods, one for pagination and one for fetching all the rows
* `has_many` relation now supports the `order` option
* Fix all syntax errors in reference manual

#### Misc

* Enhance `singularize` function, can singularize words like *Categories* to *Category*
* Main Lapis server and spec server can now be launched in different directories from the current
* Fixed a bug when setting config values that would cause function blocks to override previous function blocks instead of merging

v1.1.1 -- **April 25th 2015**

#### Models

* Add `singular_name` method to model classes, used when determining field name in relations and `inclue_in
* Add `clause` parameter to `find_all`
* `delete` method returns `true` if a row is actually removed, `false` otherwise
* Relation getters will no longer error if foreign key has `nil` value
* Fixed bug where ordered paginator with multiple keys could skip records if non-specific keys shared values

#### `lapis.cache`

* `cached` will only cache `GET` requests
* `cached` updated to not interfere with `request` method

#### Misc

* `url_for` now takes a third argument, a table of query parameters
* A flow can be passed to a flow in place of the `req` object.
* New config field, `max_request_args`, controls OpenResty's maximum request argument truncation from `get_post_args` and `get_uri_args`.
* Generated config includes pid directive to ensure compile time flags don't interfere
* New `lapis.spec` module with `use_test_env` and `use_test_server` for busted
* Fixed a bug where `respond_to` was returning multiple arguments and interfering with Lua match API

 * Multiple `content_for` of same name will now append instead of overwrite

#### Misc

 * `Flow` can now expose instance variable assignments to request with `expose_assigns`
